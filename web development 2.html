                    <p>Staying safe on social media is essential to protect your privacy and security online. Start by using strong, unique passwords for each platform and enabling two-factor authentication. Adjust your privacy settings to control who can see your posts and personal information. Be cautious about sharing sensitive details like your address, phone number, or real-time location. Watch out for scams, phishing messages, and suspicious links, and always verify friend requests before accepting them. Avoid logging into social media accounts on public Wi-Fi, as it can pose security risks. If you come across harmful or suspicious users, report and block them immediately.
                       Additionally, managing screen time is important for mental well-being, as excessive social media use can be overwhelming. By following these precautions, you can enjoy the benefits of social media while staying safe and secure online.</p>
